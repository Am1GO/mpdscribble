This is a work in progress, some quick notes:
(see the NEWS file for some more notes about changes 
 in this version)

ABOUT
   
   mpdscribble  is   a  music  player  daemon   client  which  submits
   information about tracks being played to audioscrobbler.

   mpdscribble is Copyright Â© 2005,2006 Kuno Woudt <kuno@frob.nl>


Installing mpdscribble
----------------------

See the INSTALL file.


CONFIGURE
   
   After you have installed mpdscribble, run ./setup.sh from this
   directory.  setup.sh will prompt you for your audioscrobbler 
   username and password.

   run ./setup.sh as root to install a system-wide mpdscribble 
   configuration file.
   
   For more info on using mpdscribble, try man mpdscribble

   NOTE: the previous version of setup.sh set up an init.d script
   for debian.  This is obviously better handled with a proper debian
   package, which will be available soon.  For now, the script can
   still be found in the contrib/ directory.

   WARNING: the abovementioned debian script runs mpdscribble as root,
   this is generally not a good idea, and you may want to run it as
   a regular user until a proper debian package is available.
