2006-12-03  Kuno Woudt <kuno@frob.nl>

	* configure.in: version 0.2.11

	* lmc.c:
	* lmc.h:
	* mpdscribble.c: added a little hack so skip detection doesn't 
	crossfaded songs to be submitted.

	* applied OpenBSD compilation error fixes from Eric Gillingham.

	* as.c: changed MAX_SUBMIT_COUNT from 50 to 10, according to
	protocol spec.

2006-11-19  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	* lmc.c (lmc_disconnect): checks if g_mpd is zero before closing
	connection and then zeros it; also zeros g_entity (just to keep
	convention).

2006-10-30  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	* lmc.c (lmc_failure): warning message includes 'error' not
	'errorCode' and added replacing new lines with spaces in
	'errorStr'.

2006-05-28  Kuno Woudt <kuno@frob.nl>

	* configure.in: version 0.2.10

	* mbid.c: added .ogg and .flac support for mbid fetching. 

	* mpdscribble.c: I was under the impression that songs with an mbid
	can be shorter than 30 seconds, but audioscrobbler still doesn't
	accept them -- so I've put the 30 second check back in.

	* configure.in: version 0.2.9

	* mpdscribble.c (main): added mbid support.

	* mbid.c, mbid.h: mbid fetching, contributed by David Nicolson.

	* configure.in: version 0.2.8

	* configure.in: Applied a patch from Andrey Rahmatullin which fixes
	libsoup, libgobject and libgthread detection.

	* mpdscribble.c (main): removed check for songs which are too long, 
	which is no longer required by the audioscrobbler protocol.

2006-04-30  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	* configure.in: version 0.2.7.1

	* lmc.c (lmc_failure): changed definition + it zeros g_mpd.
	* lmc.c (lmc_current): checking whether g_mpd==0 added +
	lmc_failure no longer returns 0 nor takes an argument.
	* lmc.c (lmc_reconnect): cheks for error also just after.
	mpd_newConnection() + lmc_failure no longer returns 0 nor takes an
	argument.

	* misc.c (log_date): new function
	* misc.c (fatal, fatal_errno, warning, warning_errno, notice):
	prints date to log file.
	* as.c (as_init): '\n' from logged strings removed

2005-08-28  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* configure.in: version 0.2.7

	* conn.c: 
	* as.c: changed the glib mainloop handling to let it take care of
	a transfer properly (and without 100% cpu usage :), when one is
	pending.

	* as.c (as_save_cache): don't save the cache file when there is
	nothing to save.

2005-08-16  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* configure.in: version 0.2.6

	* mpdscribble.1: added --cache-interval text.

	* misc.c (strdup2, strndup2): removed a few c99-isms, to make it
	easier to build with gcc 2.95.

	* *.c: call exit (ENOMEM) when malloc fails, instead of using 
	printf (which apparantly uses malloc on many systems).

2005-08-15  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* mpdscribble.c (main): save cache every ten minutes (configurable
	in the configuration file).

2005-08-13  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* mpdscribble.c (main): fixed bug where too much sleep()ing caused
	transfers to fail.

2005-04-17  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* configure.in: version 0.2.5

	* file.c (file_getname): changed the way the various files are
	located.  default system-wide and $HOME locations are now 
	specified in full with #defines.

	* file.c (file_read_config): when no cache file was specified,
	file_config.log would be set to the default cache file instead
	of file_config.cache.

	* mpdscribble.1: some tiny (mostly cosmetic) changes.

	* setup.sh (LOG): woops, was making directories _before_ asking
	the user if those locations are ok.  
	and removed /usr/local/bin remnants.

2005-04-04  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* configure.in: version 0.2.4
	This version replaces the simple Makefile with an
	automake/autoconf based build system.

	* as.h (AS_CLIENT_VERSION): version taken from configure.in from
	now on.

	* file.c (help): fixed a bug where --help would fail
	if the conf, log or cache could not be found. Some minor other
	changes to the help text to make it slightly more consistent with
	GNU. 

2005-04-02  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* as.c (as_songchange): better checking on (null) values submitted
	to as_songchange. (this fixes a segfault when no album tag was
	supplied).

2005-03-13  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* as.h (AS_CLIENT_VERSION): 0.2.2

	* lmc.c (lmc_reconnect): fixed sending a password if one is
	specified in the mpd host string.

	* as.h (AS_CLIENT_VERSION): 0.2.1

	* as.c (as_songchange): incomplete data check was too harsh,
	fixed. Also changed the error messages to indicate more clearly
	what's going -- including the filename of the badly tagged
	file.

	* file.c:
	* setup.sh: changes all over to support system-wide install.

2005-02-25  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* file.c: some options can be set on the command line.

	* lmc.c: reconnect to mpd when connection is lost.

	* conn.c: replaced libcurl with libsoup, hopefully soup doesn't
	segfault all over the place :)

2005-02-15  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* all over the place: changed most source files to rely less on
	C99 features, this should make it compilable with gcc-2.9x.

	* lmc.c (lmc_current): don't report mpd status errors.

	* as.c (as_submit): display post_data when verbose.

	* as.c (as_songchange): don't submit the same song twice

	* as.c (as_parse_handshake_response): correctly goes to AS_BADAUTH
	state if handshaking fails.  Will not attempt to handshake again
	or submit songs without a restart.

	* as.c (as_parse_submit_response): go back to handshaking if the
	md5 challenge is incorrect.

2005-02-12  Nikki

	* setup.sh: md5 the password instead of storing it cleartext.
	* as.c: assume password is md5 encoded in the config file.

	* conn.c:
	* conn.h:
	* as.c: changed song submit from GET to POST

2005-02-08  Kuno Woudt  <kuno@frob.nl>

	* as.c (as_cleanup): removed all the character conversion stuff,
	mpd can't give me the raw tags.
